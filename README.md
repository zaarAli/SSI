# Scene Segmentation and Interpretation:

Welcome to my Github repository for my Scene Segmentation and Interpretation subject in my Masters program. In this repository, I have implemented various challenges using Python to analyze and segment images.

The challenges I have implemented so far include:

- Challenge # 1: PFOM Edge Detectors
- Challenge # 2: Labeling Regions in Images
- Challenge # 3: Frequency Dictionary with the DFT (FFT) and Filtering
- Challenge # 4: Canny-Deriche Filter Implementation
- Challenge # 5: Segment Primitives
- Challenge # 6: Comparison of Fourier and Cosine Transform for Image Compression
- Challenge # 7: Texture identification
- Challenge # 8: 2D motion estimation

I have included code, data, and results for each challenge, and I am constantly updating the repository as I progress through the subject. Feel free to explore and use this repository as a resource for your own work in the field of scene segmentation and interpretation.
